 What is a brain tumor?
    
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of cells in or around your brain. Together, spinal tumors and brain tumors are called central nervous system (CNS) tumors.

Brain tumors can be malignant (cancerous) or benign (noncancerous). Some tumors grow quickly, while others are slow growing.

Only about one-third of brain tumors are cancerous. But whether they’re cancerous or not, brain tumors can impact brain function and your health if they grow large enough to press on surrounding nerves, blood vessels and tissue.

Tumors that develop in your brain are called primary tumors. Tumors that spread to your brain after forming in a different part of your body are called secondary tumors, or metastatic brain tumors. This article focuses on primary brain tumors.

What are the types of brain tumors?

Researchers have identified more than 150 different brain tumors.

Healthcare providers categorize primary tumors as glial (composed of glial cells in your brain) or non-glial (developed on or in the structures of your brain, including nerves, blood vessels and glands) and benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

Many types of brain tumors can also form in your spinal cord or column.

Usually benign brain tumors
Types of brain tumors that are usually benign include:

Chordomas: These slow-growing tumors typically begin at the base of your skull and the bottom part of your spine. They’re mostly benign.
Craniopharyngiomas: These tumors usually arise from a portion of your pituitary gland. They’re difficult tumors to remove because of their location near critical structures deep in your brain.
Gangliocytomas, gangliomas and anaplastic gangliogliomas: These are rare tumors that form in neurons (nerve cells).
Glomus jugulare: These tumors are typically located just under the base of your skull at the top of your jugular vein (neck vein). They’re the most common form of glomus tumor.
Meningiomas: These are the most common type of primary brain tumors. Meningiomas typically develop slowly. They form in the meninges, the layers of tissue that protect your brain and spinal cord. In rare cases, a meningioma can be malignant.
Pineocytomas: These slow-growing tumors form in your pineal gland, which is located deep in your brain and secretes the hormone melatonin.
Pituitary adenomas: These tumors form in your pituitary gland, which is located at the base of your brain. Your pituitary gland makes and controls hormones in your body. Pituitary adenomas are usually slow growing and they may release excess pituitary hormones.
Schwannomas: These are common benign brain tumors in adults. They develop from the Schwann cells in your peripheral nervous system or cranial nerves. Schwann cells assist the conduction of nerve impulses. Acoustic neuromas are the most common schwannoma. These tumors occur on your vestibular nerve (the nerve that leads from your inner ear to your brain).
Cancerous (malignant) brain tumors
Approximately 78% of cancerous primary brain tumors are gliomas. These tumors develop in glial cells, which surround and assist nerve cells. Types of gliomas include:

Astrocytoma: These tumors are the most common type of glioma. They form in the star-shaped glial cells called astrocytes. They can form in many parts of your brain, but most commonly occur in your cerebrum.
Ependymomas: These tumors often occur near the ventricles in your brain. Ependymomas develop from ependymal cells (called radial glial cells).
Glioblastoma (GBM): These tumors form in glial cells called astrocytes. GBMs are the fastest-growing astrocytoma.
Oligodendroglioma: These uncommon tumors begin in cells that create myelin (a layer of insulation around nerves in your brain).
Medulloblastoma is another type of cancerous brain tumor. These tumors are fast growing and form at the base of your skull. They’re the most common cancerous brain tumor in children.

What causes brain tumors?
Researchers know brain tumors develop when certain genes on the chromosomes of a cell are damaged and no longer function properly, but they aren’t sure why this happens. Your DNA in your chromosomes tells cells throughout your body what to do — it tells them when to grow, when to divide or multiply and/or when to die.

When brain cell DNA changes, it gives your brain cells new instructions. Your body develops abnormal brain cells that grow and multiply faster than normal and sometimes live longer than normal. When that happens, the ever-growing crowd of abnormal cells takes over space in your brain.

In some cases, a person may be born with changes in one or more of these genes. Environmental factors, such as exposure to large amounts of radiation from X-rays or previous cancer treatment, may then lead to further damage.

In other cases, the environmental injury to the genes may be the only cause.

There are a few rare, inherited (passed down from parent to child) genetic syndromes that are associated with brain tumors, including:

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1 gene).
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2 gene).
Turcot syndrome (APC gene).
Gorlin syndrome (PTCH gene).
Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1 and TSC2 genes).
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (TP53 gene).
Only about 5% to 10% of people with brain tumors have a family history of a brain tumor.


How are brain tumors treated?

Brain tumor treatment depends on several factors, including:
The tumor’s location, size and type.
The number of tumors.
Your age.
Your overall health.
Benign (noncancerous) brain tumors can usually be successfully removed with surgery and don’t usually grow back. It often depends on if your neurosurgeon can safely remove all of the tumor.

Treatments that are fairly well tolerated by the brains of adults, such as radiation therapy, may prevent the normal development of a child’s brain, especially in children younger than age five.

Healthcare providers often use a combination of therapies to treat a tumor. Your treatment options might include:

Brain surgery (craniotomy): When possible, neurosurgeons remove the tumor. They work very carefully, sometimes performing surgery when you’re awake (you won’t feel pain), to minimize damage to functional areas of your brain.
Radiation therapy: High doses of X-rays destroy brain tumor cells or shrink the tumor in this type of treatment.
Radiosurgery: This is a type of radiation therapy that uses very focused beams of radiation (gamma rays or proton beams) to destroy a tumor. It’s not actually surgery because it doesn’t require an incision (cut).
Brachytherapy: This is a form of radiation therapy. It involves surgically placing radioactive seeds, capsules or other implants directly in or near the cancerous tumor.
Chemotherapy: This therapy consists of anticancer drugs that kill cancer cells in your brain and throughout your body. You might receive chemotherapy through an injection into a vein or take it as a pill. Your healthcare provider may recommend chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells left behind or to prevent remaining tumor cells from growing.
Immunotherapy: Immunotherapy, also called biological therapy, is a type of treatment that uses your body’s immune system to fight cancer. The therapy mainly consists of stimulating your immune system to help it do its job more effectively.
Targeted therapy: With this treatment, drugs target specific features in cancer cells without harming healthy cells. Your healthcare provider may recommend targeted therapy if you have trouble tolerating the side effects of chemotherapy, such as fatigue and nausea.
Watchful waiting/active surveillance: If you have a brain tumor that’s very small and isn’t causing symptoms, your healthcare provider may recommend closely monitoring the tumor for signs of growth with regular testing.
Other treatments that help with symptoms caused by brain tumors include:

Shunts: If the tumor causes pressure within your skull to increase, you may need to have a shunt (a thin piece of tubing) surgically placed in your brain to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid.
Drugs such as mannitol and corticosteroids: These medications can help reduce pressure within your skull. They reduce swelling around the tumor.
Palliative care: This is a specialized form of care that provides symptom relief, comfort and support to people living with serious illnesses. It also provides support to caregivers and those impacted by a loved one’s condition.

    'Title': 'Getting better after treatment for brain tumours',
    'description':
    """Having treatment for a brain tumour is often life changing. Some people make a full recovery and are able to go back to work. How long it takes for you to recover depends on your individual situation. Everyone takes a different amount of time to recover. 

Unfortunately, some people aren't able to get better and need care and support for the rest of their lives. 
Problems you might have after treatment
You might have problems for some time after you finish treatment for a brain tumour. The problems you might have include: 

weakness on one side of your body
difficulty walking or moving
difficulty with speech or understanding
seizures (fits)
severe tiredness (fatigue)
problems with your vision and hearing
personality changes
memory problems
The problems you have depend on where in your brain the tumour was. In time, another area of your brain can learn to take over some of the functions that were affected by your tumour, or its treatment. You may or may not get completely back to how you were before your brain tumour. But help is available for you. 

Who can help
There are various healthcare professionals who can help you recover from a brain tumour. This might include:

a physiotherapist to help you with moving  
an occupational therapist to see what help you need with everyday activities such as dressing
a speech and language therapist to help with speech and swallowing
a social worker who can arrange for you to have help with shopping and cleaning
dietitians to help with your diet
a GP practice nurse (district nurse) who can help with practical things such as wound care
a pharmacist who can help with your medicines and dosette boxes
Your doctor or specialist nurse may be able to refer you to these services. Don't be afraid to ask for this if it is not arranged automatically.  

Going back to work
Some people make a full recovery from their brain tumour. Others will have some long term side effects. It isn't possible to tell beforehand how things will work out. 

Whether you get completely back to normal and how soon depends on:

the type of tumour you have
how big the tumour is and where it is
the treatment you had
your particular job 
Some people have difficulty concentrating or remembering details after having treatment for a brain tumour. You might not be able to go back to the same level you were before your diagnosis if you had a job where your mental skills and abilities were very important. This can be very difficult to accept and adjust to. 

You might not be able to go back to your job straight away if you operate heavy machinery. You should talk to your occupational health department if you have one. If not, talk to your manager. 

If necessary, some employers can arrange for you to take on another role until you are better. Ask about this possibility if it is not offered. You might be able to go back to work part time. Then you can go back to your regular hours once you have got your strength back.  

It might be helpful to contact a benefits advisor at your local hospital if you can't go back to the job you did before. Or contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau.

    'Title':'tests will be done to diagnose a brain tumor',
    'Image': 'images/image-medical.jpg',
    'description':'''Healthcare providers use several tests to diagnose a brain tumor, including:

Brain MRI or CT scan: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best imaging test for identifying brain tumors. Computed tomography (CT) is a good alternative if you’re unable to undergo an MRI. Before these tests, a substance that makes the tumor easier to see called a contrast agent is injected into one of your veins. These tests can show the tumor’s size and exact position in specific detail. Your healthcare provider may also look at other parts of your body, such as your lungs, colon or breasts, to see if the tumor has spread.
Biopsy: Healthcare providers usually need to do a biopsy of the tumor (removal of a sample of the tumor for examination under a microscope) to identify the type of tumor and if it’s cancerous. A neurosurgeon may perform a biopsy during surgery in which they remove all or part of the tumor. If the tumor is difficult to reach, they may perform a stereotactic biopsy, which involves creating a small hole in your skull and using a needle to take a sample of tissue from the tumor.
Spinal tap (lumbar puncture): For this procedure, your healthcare provider uses a small needle to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from around your spine. A laboratory examines this fluid to look for cancer cells. Healthcare providers use this procedure when they suspect that the tumor has invaded the layers of tissues that cover your brain (meninges).
Specialized tests: Certain tests can sometimes help with the diagnosis. For example, your healthcare provider may order tests that check your blood and cerebrospinal fluid for substances that certain tumors release called tumor markers. They can also test for gene abnormalities that are characteristic of certain tumors.

    'Title': 'Why going bald can seriously affect your mental health',
    'description':
        """Most men begin to notice thinning hair or a receding hairline in their 20s. But although male hair loss is incredibly common, it can still be very distressing and negatively affect self-esteem. Dr Max Pemberton explores the psychological impact of balding and what to do if you're losing your confidence along with your tresses.
    By the age of 50, half of all men will have noticeable hair loss. By the age of 60, it will affect around two thirds. The majority of men, therefore, will at some point in their life, have hair loss.

It's so common, in fact, going bald could be considered a normal part of being male. It's actually more unusual not to go bald. Yet despite how common male pattern baldness is, it causes untold distress and anguish to men. It's strongly associated with the development of depression, anxiety and poor self-image.
many men are able to embrace their thinning hair. Just look at Bruce Willis and Jason Statham. Some guys adopt a close-shaved look and frame it in terms of evidence of their masculinity and manliness. Good for them. For those who struggle to accept the change and lament their hair loss, there is a multi-billion pound industry that, I'm sorry to say, promises a lot but tends not to deliver.

There is no magic pill or miracle surgery to reverse hair loss. Even finasteride only actually causes re-growth of hair in a small number of people who take it, with it simply slowing the rate of loss for most. It only provides about 30% improvement in hair loss over six months. Hair grafts and transplants have limitations and are very costly with results varying considerably. Shampoos and lotions and potions have limited - if any - effect.

That's why I often recommend men who are struggling with going bald see a clinical psychologist to have a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to address their distress and help them to change their thinking about their hair loss. It sounds unlikely, but it really does work.

The fact is, it is much easier - and cheaper - to learn to accept the hair loss than it is to reverse it.

    'Title': 'What is prostate cancer?',
    'description':
        '''Prostate cancer is a cancer which develops from cells in the prostate gland. It is the most common cancer in men in the UK. Each year, about 52,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the UK. It affects about 1 in 8 men in the UK at some point in their lives. Most cases develop in men over the age of 75 years.

Prostate cancer is often slow-growing, does not reduce life expectancy, and may not need treatment. In some cases it is more aggressive, spreads to other parts of the body and may benefit from treatment. In general, the more advanced the cancer (the more it has grown and spread), the less chance that treatment will be curative. However, treatment can often slow the progress of the cancer.
Prostate cancer causes
Although the exact cause is unclear, certain risk factors increase the chance that prostate cancer may develop. These include:

Ageing. Most cases occur in older men.
Family history and genetic factors. If your father or brother had prostate cancer at a relatively early age (before the age of 60 years) then you have an increased risk. Also, if the type of breast cancer which is linked to a faulty gene runs in your female relatives then you are at increased risk of prostate cancer. These factors point towards a faulty gene which may occur in some men.
Ethnic group. Prostate cancer is more common in African-Caribbean men and less common in Asian men.
Obesity is a risk factor for advanced prostate cancer.
Diet is possibly a risk factor. As with other cancers, a diet high in fats and low in fruit and vegetables may increase the risk.
Exposure to the metal cadmium may be a risk.

    'description':
        """Do you know how old your heart is? The obvious answer, of course, is 'As old as my tongue and a little older than my teeth' - but it's not that kind of age I'm talking about. You can turn back the clock on heart attack risks by improving your lifestyle.
    Obviously, your age (the one on your birth certificate!) affects your risk of heart disease, and try as we'd like, we can't change that. So does your gender - women don't suffer heart attacks as often as men do, but there's no room for complacency. In fact, 68,000 women in the UK have a heart attack every year, compared to 120,000 men. But let's look at all the ways you can improve your risks
    Stop smoking
One of them is right under your nose (and that of everyone else within sniffing distance of you) - smoking.

Stopping smoking is probably the single biggest favour you can do your body, and while it may not be easy, there has never been more support. You can find out about local NHS services by phoning free on 0300 123 1044 in England, 0800 84 84 84 in Scotland or 0800 085 2219 in Wales. Alternatively, PHE's support includes a free personal quit plan.

It's often as simple as making an appointment with a local pharmacist, who can offer advice and smoking cessation aids such as nicotine replacement or the medication varenicline. You're far more likely to quit successfully by using a combination of support and smoking cessation aids (including vaping) than with willpower alone.

Amazingly, levels are now down from a peak of 45% of adults smoking to 17% of men and 13% of women today - you could join them!

Get active
The benefits of regular exercise are pretty much endless - in addition to strengthening your heart and cutting your risk of both heart attack and stroke, weight-bearing exercise cuts your risk of osteoporosis (thinning of the bones) and can boost your mood and reduce your risk of depression.

The key from your heart's perspective is aerobic exercise - the kind that gets your heart pumping and makes you mildly out of puff. PHE recommends about 150 minutes a week - that's equivalent to half an hour five times a week. For years, 'standard' advice has recommended that people aim for 10,000 steps a day. But, in fact, doing that much or more may not help your heart much; it's all done at gentle strolling pace, while less can do great things for your heart if it's intense enough to get heart and pulse rate up.

That's where PHE initiatives such as Active 10 and or the Couch to 5k app come in. You don't need to deck yourself out in lycra or pay a fortune for a gym - they can help you incorporate activity easily into your day-to-day routine

Check your blood pressure
High blood pressure is right up there at the top of the list too, where risk factors are concerned. It's also probably the single biggest risk factor for stroke. You won't know you've got high blood pressure unless you have it checked - except in very rare situations, high blood pressure doesn't cause short-term symptoms, but it puts a huge strain on your heart.

High blood pressure can be effectively controlled in the vast majority with daily medication - but clearly, you need to keep taking the tablets and have your blood pressure checked regularly. Cutting the salt in your diet also goes a long way to reducing your blood pressure.

  {
    'Title': 'High Blood Pressure',
    'description':
        """High blood pressure (hypertension) happens when the force on the walls of blood vessels (caused by the blood within them) is more than normal. This means the heart has to work harder and the blood vessels are under more strain, making it a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke and other serious conditions.
    What is blood pressure?
Your blood pressure reading will have two figures, one 'over' the other - for example, 140/80. The higher figure (called the systolic level) is a measure of the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is pumping blood out. The lower figure (called the diastolic level) is a measure of the pressure inside your arteries when your heart is resting between heartbeats. Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mm Hg).

A one-off blood pressure reading that is high does not mean that you have high blood pressure. Your blood pressure varies throughout the day. It may be high for a short time if you are anxious, stressed, or have just been exercising.

What are the symptoms of high blood pressure?
The vast majority of people with high blood pressure do not know they have it, until it causes a complication such as a stroke or heart attack. Usually high blood pressure is only picked up if blood pressure is checked routinely, or as part of checks for another medical problem.

Occasionally if blood pressure is very high, you can get headaches. Even more occasionally, some people feel a bit dizzy, or their vision can be affected by high blood pressure.

Other than the blood pressure reading being high, there isn't usually anything for the doctor to find on examination either. If blood pressure has been high for some time, or very high, there can be changes in the blood vessels at the back of the eye.

How is high blood pressure diagnosed?
You have high blood pressure if you have several blood pressure readings that are high, taken on different occasions, and when you are relaxed.

High blood pressure (hypertension) is a blood pressure that is 140/90 mm Hg or above each time it is taken at the GP surgery, or home or ambulatory readings where the average is more than 135/85 mm Hg. That is, it is sustained at this level.

Unless a single level is extremely high, your doctor will not make a diagnosis of high blood pressure without an average of several readings, usually from home or ambulatory measurements. Blood pressure recording outside of the doctor's surgery is recommended in most people who are suspected of having high blood pressure.

One reason for this is because some people become anxious in medical clinics. This can cause the blood pressure to rise. (This is often called white coat hypertension.) Home or ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure may show that the blood pressure is normal when you are relaxed.

However, if you have diabetes, or have recently had a heart attack or stroke, you may be advised to have blood pressure checks fairly often over the following week or so. Also, treatment with medication is usually considered at an earlier stage if the high blood pressure readings remain high.

Treatments for high blood pressure
As you can see in our leaflet on home and ambulatory blood pressure, doctors rarely treat high blood pressure on the basis of a single reading. Instead, guidelines suggest they should check your average blood pressure at home or using a machine you wear for 24 hours to measure your 'ambulatory blood pressure'.

It is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) that medication to help control high blood pressure should be used in addition to lifestyle advice for persistent stage 2 hypertension (clinic blood pressure measured as 160/100 mm Hg or higher but less than 180/120 mm Hg and home or anbulatory blood pressure average of 150/95 mm Hg or higher).

You might also be advised to start taking medication if you are aged under 80 with persistent stage 1 hypertension (clinic blood pressure between 140/90 mm Hg and 159/99 mm Hg and home or ambulatory blood pressure average of 135/85 mm Hg to 149/94 mm Hg) if it is found that the high blood pressure has caused any damage, such as to your eyes, heart or kidneys, or if you also have known cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, diabetes, or if it is found that you have a 10 year risk of a heart attack or stroke of above 10%.

Medication may be considered in addition to lifestyle advice if you are aged under 60 with stage 1 hypertension.

Medication may also be considered in addition to lifestyle advice if you are aged over 80 with stage 1 hypertension if your clinic blood pressure is over 150/90 mm Hg.

If you have 'grade 1 hypertension' clinic blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg to 159/99 mm Hg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average blood pressure 135/85 mm Hg to 149/94 mm Hg - blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg in clinic or average blood pressure of 135/85 mm Hg, doctors will check your 10-year risk of heart attack or stroke. This takes into account several factors including your age, gender, cholesterol levels and other medical conditions, as well as your blood pressure.

NICE recommends starting treatment if your 10-year risk is over 10%. That means many more people may be offered tablets to protect them against heart attack and stroke.

There are many different medicines for high blood pressure. They work in various different ways. Your doctor will advise on the best one for you. If it doesn't work, or you have side-effects, there are plenty of other options. The idea is to find you one or more pills which suit you, and which control your blood pressure. Once you and your doctor have cracked it, you'll need to keep taking your medication long-term to make sure you stay protected. Your blood pressure will be checked regularly and medication adjusted if need be.

    'Title': 'Electrocardiogram',
    'description':
        """An electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart. The heart produces tiny electrical impulses which spread through the heart muscle to make the heart contract. These impulses can be detected by the ECG machine. You may have an ECG to help find the cause of symptoms such as the feeling of a 'thumping heart' (palpitations) or chest pain. Sometimes it is done as part of routine tests - for example, before you have an operation.

The ECG test is painless and harmless. (The ECG machine records electrical impulses coming from your body - it does not put any electricity into your body.)

What does an electrocardiogram (ECG) show?
The electrodes placed on the different parts of the body detect electrical impulses coming from different directions within the heart. There are normal patterns for each electrode. Various heart disorders produce abnormal patterns. The heart disorders that can be detected include:

Abnormal heart rhythms. If the heart rate is very fast, very slow, or irregular. There are various types of irregular heart rhythm with characteristic ECG patterns.
A heart attack (myocardial infarction) and if it was recent or some time ago. A heart attack causes damage to heart muscle and it heals with scar tissue. These can be detected by abnormal ECG patterns.
An enlarged heart. Basically, this causes bigger impulses than normal.
What does a normal ECG look like?
When reviewing an ECG, the healthcare professional will look at several different aspects.

These include the rate (how fast the heart is beating), the rhythm (whether the heartbeat is regular or irregular), the cardiac axis (direction of electrical spread within the heart), and an analysis of the different parts of the electrical wave.

The points of interest may vary depending on the reason for an ECG - for example, a doctor reviewing an ECG done in the emergency department for acute chest pain will be looking for signs of a heart attack. In contrast, for a routine ECG arranged by a GP who has noticed an irregular heartbeat, they may be particularly looking for an irregularity and absent P waves. These are a sign of atrial fibrillation, a common cause of heartbeat irregularities.

In recent years we have become more aware of the importance of the QT interval, the distance between two parts of the electrical wave. Some drugs should not be used if the patient has a prolonged QT inverval and therefore this will usually be looked at when interpreting an ECG.

How is an ECG done?
Small metal electrodes are stuck on to your chest. Wires from the electrodes are connected to the ECG machine. The machine detects and amplifies the electrical impulses that occur at each heartbeat and records them on to a paper or computer. A few heartbeats are recorded from different sets of electrodes.

How long does an ECG take?
The test takes about five minutes to do. Sometimes a small ECG machine can be worn for prolonged periods to see whether you have an irregular heart rhythm. This is called an ambulatory electrocardiogram.

Is an ECG result always accurate

Any test can have a false positive, or false negative result done. It is crucial that an ECG is read by a professional who has the skills to do so, so that they can interpret the trace in conjunction with the clinical history and examination. Some changes will have a significant impact on the need for future tests, or treatment, whereas others will be less important.
